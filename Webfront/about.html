                <p>No Generative AI was used in the making of this site.</p>
                <p>AI is a danger to thw world at large, from misinformation to environmental AI is a threat to our future.
                AI is a misinformation machine, it will agree with you and give you false information to make you happy. It does not care or have morality, the cooperations that have created these public access LLMs have done so not for the benefit of mankind but purely for profit.</p>
                <p>AI datacenters consume upwards of Five Million Gallons of water daily<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/explosive-ai-buildout-brings-into-question-water-supply-concerns-exploring-how-data-centers-could-curb-water-demands" target="_blank">*</a>, this water comes from the fresh water drinking supply, 80% of the water is evaporated during the process of cooling. The leftover water is then dumped into rivers or sewer systems that are old and under rated.
                The water used to cool an AI datacenter is less then the water used in generating the electricity for said datacenter.
                AI is pushing for a 165% increase in power demand for datacenters<a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030" target="_blank">*</a></p>
