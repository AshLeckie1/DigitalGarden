# Planning questions

## Organization

- Do we want a main feed that shows all posts? \
- Do we want the ability to have separate "threads" areas for posts that are related by a topic? \
- Do we want user profile pages that are customizable?

## Access

Is this going to be publicly accessible and what levels of access should be granted.

Can only add users through invitation.

Should non registered users be able to access the site and view posts.

## Style

This is something that will be more important down the line, but what style should the site be done in. \

- what form factor should it take?
- are users more likely to use phones or desktop?

## Posts

- are we happy to go forward with markdown as a format?
